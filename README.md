# static-site-example
This repository contains a template for websites built using only html, css, and javascript that don't require a hosting server to load.

## getting started
The goal of this repo is to not need a development environment nor a build step, so modifications should be able to be made directly into each file. Deploys should be as simple as copying the files to the deployment slot.
